1. Add beers-per-page functionality which is available to the API call
2. Add additional filters for hop-type or perhaps filtering description terms.
3. Needs a bug-fix for disabled next-page button if total available beers in the
    API happens to be wholly divisble by beers-per-page.
    Example: 250 beers, 25-per-page, allows pagination to continue 1-beyond
    and shows a blank beer-list for that page
